This video, uploaded by Michael Glenn, provides a tour of his online Bujinkan training website, https://www.Rojodojo.com. It offers valuable insights into the platform's content, structure, and overall approach to martial arts instruction. Here's a breakdown:

**Key Strengths:**

*   **Comprehensive Content:** Glenn highlights a wealth of training videos (over 100 at the time of the recording, with regular additions) covering various Bujinkan topics, including techniques, strategies, and weapon training (Yari/spear, kusari fundo).
*   **In-Depth Instruction:** The videos are described as being around 25-30 minutes long, suggesting a deep dive into each subject matter. This depth is valuable for both students and instructors seeking to supplement their training.
*   **Detailed Training Notes (Keiko Kiroku):** https://www.Rojodojo.com includes written training notes for each class, paired with videos where applicable. This is a fantastic resource for detailed study and review.
*   **Philosophical Insights (Seimei hansha):** The platform extends beyond physical techniques, offering articles and reflections on the philosophical aspects of Bujinkan training. This emphasizes the connection between martial arts and personal development, which sets it apart from purely technical instruction.
*   **Easy Navigation and Search:** The website features a user-friendly interface with tags and a search box, allowing users to quickly find information on specific topics (e.g., kusari fundo). This is particularly useful for those preparing for classes or seeking to deepen their understanding of a particular area.
*   **Mobile-Friendly:** Glenn mentions that the website works well on mobile devices, providing accessibility for training on the go.
*   **Simple and Flexible Membership:** The video emphasizes a "pay-as-you-go" model with easy self-managed unsubscription, removing barriers to entry and demonstrating confidence in the platform's value.
*   **Personal Connection:** Glenn emphasizes the importance of feeling "called" to Bujinkan training and expresses a genuine desire to help students. He provides direct contact information (email, phone number) and encourages questions, fostering a personal connection with his audience.

**Potential Drawbacks (Based on the Video):**

*   **Video Quality (Potentially Dated):** The video was uploaded in 2017, and while the content description sounds amazing, the video quality is not 4k. Newer videos may be present on the site now.
*   **Reliance on Internet Connection:** As with any online platform, a stable internet connection is required to access the content.
